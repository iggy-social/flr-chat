## .env

## Hosting

We recommend to use Netlify for hosting the site. Netlify allows you to easily deploy the site from this repo (or from a fork of this repository).

Make sure to use the the `npm run generate` command instead of `npm run build` for build instructions on Netlify.

If you want to use optional features such as GIFs and image upload, make sure to enter proper environment variables (see `.env.example`).

## GIFs (Tenor)

If you want to have GIF search implemented, create your own Tenor API Key on Google Cloud Console. Follow the instructions here: https://developers.google.com/tenor/guides/quickstart. 

Then enter the key in environment variables (`TENOR_KEY`).

## Image upload (Web3 Storage)

To support image uploads on IPFS please create an API key on Web3 Storage: https://web3.storage/ 

Then enter the key in environment variables (`WEB3_STORAGE_KEY`).
